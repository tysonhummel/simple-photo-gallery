<h1>Simple Photo Gallery</h1>

<p>This lightweight package of HTML, CSS and jQuery/javascript is a quick way to implement a simple, bare-bones photo gallery.</p>

<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>It makes a simple viewer out of your thumbnails with previous and next controls and a close button.</p>
<p>The next and previous buttons are css only and resize with the browser, no images needed.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Put your images inside a div with a class of "photo-thumbs".</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>You can have multiple galleries on a page.</li>
			<li>There is an example in gallery.html that utilizes Bootstrap.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Include the jQuery and gallery files.  Bootstrap provides responsiveness and is optional.</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>jquery-2.0.3.min.js</li>
			<li>gallery.js</li>
			<li>gallery.css</li>
			<li>boostrap.min.js (optional)</li>
			<li>boostrap.min.css (optional)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Done.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Currently, it uses the same image for the thumbnails and the single image view. I realize that this can be a problem if you have a lot of hi-res images. Maybe I'll fix that in the future.</p>

<p>This is a no-frills situation. You'll have to add your own bells and whistles.</p>

<p>Use it, modify it, sing to it. Whatevs.</p>
