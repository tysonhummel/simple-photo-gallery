<h1>Simple Gallery</h1>

<p>This lightweight package of HTML, CSS and jQuery/javascript is a quick way to implement a simple photo gallery.</p>

<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>It makes a viewer out of your thumbnails.</p>
<p>The next and previous buttons are css only and resize with the browser, no images needed.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Put your images inside a div with an class of "photo-thumbs". You can have multiple galleries on a page. There is an example in gallery.html.</li>
	<li>Include jQuery, Bootstrap, gallery.css and gallery.js.</li>
	<li>Done.</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently, it uses the same image for the thumbnails and the single image view. I realize that this can be a problem if you have a lot of images. Maybe I'll fix that in the future.</p>

<p>This is a no-frills situation. You'll have to add your own bells and whistles.</p>

<p>Use it, modify it, sing to it. Whatevs.</p>
