<h1>Simple Gallery</h1>

<p>This lightweight package of HTML, CSS and jQuery/javascript is a quick way to implement a simple photo gallery.</p>

<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>It makes a viewer out of your thumbnails.</p>
<p>The next and previous buttons are css only and resize with the browser, no images needed.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Put your images inside a div with an class of "photo-thumbs". 
		<ul>
			<li>You can have multiple galleries on a page.</li>
			<li>There is an example in gallery.html.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Include the jQuery, Bootstrap, gallery files.
		<ul>
			<li>jQuery
				<ul>
					<li>jquery-2.0.3.min.js
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Bootstrap
				<ul>
					<li>boostrap.min.css</li>
					<li>boostrap.min.js</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Gallery
				<ul>
					<li>gallery.css</li>
					<li>gallery.js</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Done.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Currently, it uses the same image for the thumbnails and the single image view. I realize that this can be a problem if you have a lot of images. Maybe I'll fix that in the future.</p>

<p>This is a no-frills situation. You'll have to add your own bells and whistles.</p>

<p>Use it, modify it, sing to it. Whatevs.</p>
